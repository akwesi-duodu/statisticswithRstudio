final semester's project on the relationship between carbon emissions in industry against carbon emissions from transport.

I pursued this project to gain a nuanced
understanding of the interrelationships of variables concerning carbon emissions and climate
change. This study can provide for the gap in clearly disseminating government policy
decisions on climate. By this research, it can be inferred or established that policy concerning
climate change should not be designed on the premise of just an analysis of one sector but on
having analysed lurking variables that affect the climate. The overarching question that intrigued me, given the host of datasets to choose from, was with the carbon emissions dataset. My research formally tested for an association
between carbon emissions from electricity and heat and carbon emissions from buildings
together with the primal research question on the association between carbon emissions from
transport and from industry. The sample under study for all of these questions was drawn
from carbon emissions in industry, electricity and heat, buildings and transport for all
countries on or after 2015 to provide a more contemporary study. It was necessary to subset
the years because the initial dataset was rather bulky and choosing to pin the analysis over a
30-year span rather than tailoring it to be more recent may not necessarily reveal
contemporary trends. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, an online community platform
used by data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts for research. The platform prioritises
the use of data for analysis in data science and modelling. The variables used in the study
were the countries, year, carbon emissions from industry, transport, buildings and emissions
from electricity and heat. The explanatory variable was the carbon emissions from industry
and the response variable was the carbon emissions from transport.
